## App Performance Prediction with Supervised and Unsupervised ML Models

This project analyzes app performance and user engagement by leveraging a variety of machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and predict success factors. It includes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, K-means Clustering for segmentation, and Association Rule Mining (ARM) for discovering relationships between app attributes. Supervised models such as Naive Bayes, Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Ensemble Methods (including Random Forest and Boosting) are used to build predictive models, achieving high accuracy and optimized performance.  

### **Project Highlights**:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and key features affecting app performance.  
- **Unsupervised Learning Models**: PCA for feature reduction and Clustering for segmentation.  
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Naive Bayes, Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM for classification tasks.  
- **Ensemble Methods**: Random Forest and Boosting for enhanced accuracy and performance optimization.
